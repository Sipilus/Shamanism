----------------------------------------------------------------
How to get started:
You can start the Shamanism Datapack experience as soon as you enter your world. By breaking grass blocks you have a chance to recieve a "Spirit Herb". If you eat this herb, you may notice some negative side effects but you will now be considered a Shaman!

After eating the spirit herb, you will now be able to utilize and craft tools and magic that only Shaman are capable of.

DREAMCATCHER:

The first thing you'll want to do is craft a dreamcatcher on a bone block using 4 sticks and 4 string, once you have a dreamcatcher, you can now collect spirit fragments from mobs by right-clicking them, but you can only do this during a spirit trance! Be warned: you can only collect from a mob once, after that you need to collect from another. (ex: cow1 was collected from, must now collect from cow2 and so on...)

SPIRIT TRANCE:
There are multiple ways to enter a spirit trance, the most basic way is to eat a spirit herb. Spirit herbs inflict negative side effects for 15 seconds as well as the spirit trance status.

Spirit Mushrooms are another way to gain the spirit trance status, they last half the time of spirit herbs but lack the negative effects, they can be found by brekaing mushrooms(red or brown!)

Shamanic Stew is crafted on top of a bone block with 1 spirit herb, 1 spirit mushroom, and a bowl. Shamanic stew gives the spirit trance status for 15 seconds with no negative side effects.

SPIRIT FRAGMENTS:
Spirit fragments are collected from creatures by using the dreamcatcher while under the effects of a spirit trance, there are 8 types of fragments you can collect, based on the types of creatures!

Animal, Human, Monster, Nether, and End fragments for normal mobs.

Elder Guardian, Wither, and Dragon fragments for bosses!

SPIRIT ITEMS:

Spirit string can be crafted on top of a bone block with 4 animal spirit fragments and 1 string.

Spirit bottles can be crafted on top of a bone block with 8 spirit fragments of the same type and a glass bottle.

PRIMAL ITEMS:

The primal spear can be crafted on top of a bone block with 2 sticks, 1 stone block, 2 spirit string, and 4 human spirit fragments.

The primal axe can be crafted on top of a bone block with 1 stick, 2 stone blocks, 3 spirit string, and 4 human spirit fragments.

SHAMAN ITEMS:

The shaman hood can be crafted using 2 wolf pelts(dropped by wolves!!) and 3 spirit string. Wearing this hood gives the user a permanent spirit trance while equipped. Right-click to equip the item, but make sure that you do not have a helmet on or it will be deleted!

The master shaman hood can be crafted using 1 of each spirit bottle and 1 of each boss spirit fragment. Wearing this hood gives the user a permanent spirit trance while equipped, as well as 5 armor and an entire extra row of hearts! Right-click to equip the item, but make sure that you do not have a helmet on or it will be deleted!

SPIRIT STAVES:
The magical offensive toolkit of the shaman is derived from their spirit staves.

To craft a spirit staff, you place the corresponding spirit bottle(animal spirit bottle for animal spirit staff), 2 sticks, and 2 spirit string on top of a bone block.

There are 5 different spirit staves:

Animal Spirit Staff - Call upon nature to attack your foe!

Human Spirit Staff - Destructive nature of humanity!

Monster Spirit Staff - Wrath of the night!

Nether Spirit Staff - Fiery forces!

End Spirit Staff - Mystical projectiles!

SPIRIT TOTEMS:

Shaman can empower themselves through the usage of spirit totems.
While holding a spirit totem, you gain positive effects based on the bound spirit!

To craft a spirit totem you must first make an empty spirit totem on top of a bone block with 1 stick, 1 diamond, and 1 bone meal.

then to bind a spirit to a totem you place the empty spirit totem and 8 spirit fragments of the same type onto a bone block and you will create a spirit totem!

there are 5 totems:

Animal Spirit Totem - Animalistic Agility!

Human Spirit Totem - The Human Spirit!

Monster Spirit Totem - Monsterous Physicality!

Nether Spirit Totem - Firewalker!

End Spirit Totem - Mystic Ascention!
